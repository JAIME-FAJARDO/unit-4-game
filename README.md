Crystal Collector Game
Project Description
CrystalCollector is the result of the fourth assignment for UCLA's Coding Bootcamp.

CrystalCollector is an interactive game for web browsers, which dynamically manipulates and updates the HTML document with jQuery API documentation.

* CSS3 Custom Stylesheet

Getting Started
Instructions:
There will be four crystals displayed on the page. Each crystal contains a hidden value.

The player will be shown a randomly generated number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal, the crystal's pertaining value will be added to the player's total score.

The game hides each crystal value until the player clicks on the crystal.
The player wins if their total score matches the random target number displayed at game start.

The player will receive a loss if their total score exceeds the random target number.

When the player either wins or loses, the game will reset with a new random target number, generate new hidden values for each crystal, and reset the player's total score counter.

No browser refresh necessary; the game will reset automatically after a win or loss.
